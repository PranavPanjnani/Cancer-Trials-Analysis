# Cancer-Trials-Analysis
ðŸš€ About the Project:

In this project, I navigated the landscape of clinical trials with a focus on cancer research. Leveraging SQL queries, I extracted valuable insights from the Aggregated Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov database.

The database is publicly available on the AACT website and consists of over 50 tables, however for my analysis, I focused on the following tables:
- Studies- Key study details, including title, registration, start/completion dates, phase, enrollment, and arm/group information.
- Conditions- Names of diseases or conditions studied, with optional Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms.
- Eligibilities- Criteria for participant selection, encompassing inclusion/exclusion details.
- Facilities- Participating facility details, including names, addresses, and recruiting statuses.
- Interventions- Information on study interventions or exposures, e.g., drugs, devices, procedures.
- Outcomes- Descriptions of measured outcomes, including time frames, populations, and units.
- Outcome Measurements- Summary data for primary and secondary outcome measures, with parameter estimates.
- Reported Events- Summary info on adverse events, covering untoward medical occurrences, including serious events and mortality.
